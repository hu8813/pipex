## What is pipe?
Pipex is a method of inter-process communication (IPC) in the Unix operating system. It allows processes to communicate with each other by exchanging data through a "pipe" that acts as a buffer. This allows processes to run concurrently and asynchronously, allowing for more efficient use of system resources.

## Some useful resources for understanding pipex:
