## What is pipe?
Pipe is a method of inter-process communication (IPC) in the Unix operating system. It allows processes to communicate with each other by exchanging data through a "pipe" that acts as a buffer. This allows processes to run concurrently and asynchronously, allowing for more efficient use of system resources.


Here is an example of a simple program that uses a pipe in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  // Declare variables
  int pipefd[2];
  char buf[100];

  // Create the pipe
  if (pipe(pipefd) == -1) {
    perror("pipe");
    return 1;
  }

  // Write to the pipe
  if (write(pipefd[1], "hello world\n", 12) == -1) {
    perror("write");
    return 1;
  }

  // Read from the pipe
  if (read(pipefd[0], buf, 100) == -1) {
    perror("read");
    return 1;
  }

  // Print the message
  printf("Message: %s", buf);

  // Close the pipe
  close(pipefd[0]);
  close(pipefd[1]);

  return 0;
}
``` 

In this example, the program creates a pipe using the `pipe` function. It then writes a message to the pipe using the `write` function, and reads the message from the pipe using the `read` function. Finally, it prints the message to the console and closes the pipe.

This is a very simple example that only shows the basic usage of a pipe
